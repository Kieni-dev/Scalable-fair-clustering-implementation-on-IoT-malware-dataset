## Scalable-fair-clustering-implementation-on-IoT-malware-dataset
An implementation of the scalable fair clustering algorithm on IoT malware dataset.

## The preprocessingMain.ipynb contains the main module which imports and implements the methods in data_processing.ipynb.

## The Datapreprocessing module is data_preprocessing.ipynb. This module contains methods that;
 
1. loads the dataset including the target

2. Does a feature selection using PCA for 5, 10, 20 and 30 Features respectively

3. Adds feature names to the dataset and converts it to a dataframe

4. Replaces target strings with 0's and 1's and drops date and time columns

5. Moves target column to the first column to comply with scalable fair clustering requirement


## The scalable fair clustering module is ModifiedFair_Clustering.ipynb. Usage:

ModifiedFair_Clustering.ipynb p q k dataset.csv [N]

p,q: Two integers that define the desired cluster balance. Namely, for p<=q, each output cluster with R red points and B blue points would satisfy min(R/B, B/R) >= p/q.

k: number of output clusters (k in k-median)

dataset.csv: Dataset file name, in CSV format. Each row represents a data point, and is a list of comma-separated numerical values. The first value is 0/1 and represents the sensitive color class (red/blue) of the point, the remaining values are its features.

N (optional): Integer sample size. If given, the code would run on a random sample of N records from the dataset. If not given, the code would run on the whole dataset.

The main part of the code computes a fairlet decomposition of the dataset (as defined in Chierichetti et al). Then a usual (non-fair) k-median algorithm is invoked on the fairlet centers. The resulting clustering is then extended to the whole dataset by assigning each data point to the cluster that contains its fairlet center. The yields the final fair clustering.

It then calculates the accuracy, precision and execution time of the algorithm.
